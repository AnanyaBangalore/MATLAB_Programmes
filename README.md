# MATLAB_Programmes
It holds the MATLAB lab files I developed. The files contain MATLAB functions, simulations, and scripts that I developed for my homework.

Each lab file is associated with a particular assignment or project and contains a concise description of the issue being tackled along with any presumptions and restrictions. The files are arranged according to lab sessions and include information on a variety of subjects, such as machine learning, control systems, and signal processing.

These lab files offer a thorough introduction to MATLAB and show how to use it to solve engineering and scientific issues. Students and professionals who are interested in computational tools and numerical methods can use them.
